# simple-http-codes

Tired of having to look up the correct http response code? Well now you can easily find out the appropriate code without leaving your IDE ðŸ¥³.

No more returning 500ðŸ›‘ for every error.

This package simply defines a namespace for HTTPCodes, grouping them in their category, and provides jsdocs with a short description and link for more information.
All information is based on the [RFC 9110 : HTTP Semantics](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110) ðŸ“–

## Usage ðŸ§°

Simply install the npm package, import the HTTPCodes object...and use it! It's that simple :)

### NPM Package

npm i simple-http-codes
```

### JsDocs ðŸ““

Each HTTP Code has a jsdoc with:

-   a brief description of it's usage
-   a link providing detailed information
-   an optional "related" field for ambiguous status codes
    -   i.e. Code 200 represents a successful response, but it may be more meaningful to use 201 or 204
